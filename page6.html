           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some merchants are not prepared to ship overseas and will not allow international credit cards and or shipping addresses outside the country in which site does its business. Other sites allow customers from anywhere to send gifts anywhere in the world. The financial part of a transaction may be processed in real time (for example, letting the consumer know immediately that a credit card has been declined), or might be done later as part of the fulfillment process.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While credit cards are currently the most popular means of paying for online goods and services, Celent reported in 2008 that alternative payments accounted for 15 percent of e-commerce transactions, and predicted that by 2015, alternative payment methods would be used for $1.7 billion of online transactions.</p>
