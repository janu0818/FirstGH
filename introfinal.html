    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Online shopping 
	is the process of researching and purchasing products or services over the Internet. The earliest
	online stores went into business in 1992, and online retailing took over a significant segment of
	the retail market during the first decade of the twenty-first century, as ownership of personal
	computers increased and established retailers began to offer their products over the Internet. The
	Nielsen Company estimates that during 2007, 875 million people worldwide made at least one purchase 
	online. By 2011, it is believed that nine percent of United States retail sales will be online sales. Online
	shopping requires a computer and a credit card. It is popular in some developing countries where many items are not available in stores.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic commerce is used for both business-to-business
	(B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. Buying products from an online shop, eshop, e-store, internet shop, webshop, webstore,
	online store, or virtual store is similar to purchasing from a mail order catalog. Online stores describe products for sale with text, photos,
	and multimedia files. Typically the customer selects items to be listed on an order form known as a “shopping cart,” and pays with a credit
	card or some form of electronic payment. The products are then shipped to the customer’s address, or in the case of digital media products such
	as music, software, e-books or movies, may be downloaded onto the customer’s computer. Online shopping has some advantages over shopping in retail
	stores, including the ability to easily compare prices from a range of merchants, access to a wide selection of merchandise, and the convenience of 
	not having to drive to a physical store. Online merchants have refined shipping methods and developed incentives such as generous return policies to
	overcome obstacles like delays in receiving purchases and the inability to try on or sample merchandise before buying. Online shopping cannot replace
	the experience of shopping in a retail store or the entertainment value of going to a mall or market, in 2009 it was thought that that the rapid growth 
	of online shopping would eventually level off.</p>
