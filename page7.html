            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once a payment has been accepted the goods or services can be delivered in a number of ways:</p>
        
            <ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Download: This is the method often used for digital media products such as software, music, movies, or images.
<li>Shipping: The product is shipped to the customer's address.
<li>Postal service: The merchant uses regular mail services to send the product.
<li>Drop shipping: The order is passed to the manufacturer or third-party distributor, who ships the item directly to the consumer, bypassing the retailer's physical location to save time, money, and space.
<li>In-store pickup: The customer orders and pays online, finds a local store using locator software and picks the product up at the closest store. This is the method often used in the bricks and clicks business model.
<li>If the purchase is an admission ticket or a gift card, the customer may receive a numerical code, or a ticket that can be printed out and presented at the gate. To prevent duplication, the same right of admission cannot be used twice.
<li>Electronic check-in: A customer purchasing an airline ticket receives only a confirmation email, and checks in at the airport by swiping the same credit card or a passport at a kiosk.

            <h2>SHOPPING CART SYSTEM</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                     <li> Simple shopping cart systems do not use an online database. The merchant creates an offline database of products, categories, graphics and prices, and then uploads it to an online shopping cart.
                     <li>Sophisticated shopping cart software can be bought or rented as a standalone program or as an addition to an enterprise resource planning program. It is usually installed on the company's own Web server and may be integrated into the company’s existing supply chain system so that ordering, payment, delivery, accounting and fulfillment can be automated to a large extent.
                     <li>A merchant can register and create an online shop on a portal that hosts multiple shops and offers additional services such as credit card processing.
                      <li>Open source shopping cart packages include advanced platforms such as Interchange, and off the shelf solutions as Satchmo, osCommerce, Magento, Zen Cart, VirtueMart and PrestaShop. These can be tailored to suit the merchant’s needs.
