        <h2>3.Future development:</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of growth of online sales began to slow during 2007, prompting many analysts to predict that growth will drop dramatically after 2010 and level off soon afterwards. Researchers have concluded that most of the consumers who are interested in online shopping have already begun purchasing online, and their numbers will not increase as they did over the decade from 1997 to 2007.[5] Future growth will come through improvements to the shopping process on existing Web sites; the implementation of more online shopping sites by existing retailers; the coming of age of a younger, more technology-oriented generation; and the introduction of novel goods, services and online shopping experiences. The growth of online shopping in developing nations will occur as more people acquire personal computers and credit cards.</p>
