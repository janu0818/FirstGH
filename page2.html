    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of online shopping predates the World Wide Web. A technology for real-time transaction processing from a domestic television, based on Videotext, was first demonstrated in 1979 by Michael Aldrich, who designed and installed systems in the UK, including the first Tesco pilot system in 1984. The first business-to-business (B2B) computer network was created by Thomson Holidays in 1981.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1990 Tim Berners-Lee created the first World Wide Web server and browser. In 1992 Charles Stack created the first online bookstore, Book Stacks Unlimited (Books.com), two years before Jeff Bezos started Amazon.com. In 1994 other advances took place, such as online banking and the opening of an online pizza shop by Pizza Hut. During that same year, Netscape introduced SSL encryption (Secure Sockets Layer) of data transferred online, which has become essential for secure online shopping. In 1995 Amazon expanded its online shopping, and in 1996 eBay appeared.</p>
