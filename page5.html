            <h2 class="h2">Merchant:</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many successful virtual retailers sell digital products, (including information storage, retrieval, and modification), music, movies, education, communication, software, photography, and financial transactions. Examples of this type of company include: Google, eBay and Paypal. Large numbers of successful marketers, including numerous sellers on eBay, use Drop shipping or affiliate marketing techniques to facilitate transactions of tangible goods without maintaining real inventory. Small items such as books, CDs and jewelry that have a high value-to-weight and can easily fit into a standard mailbox are particularly suitable for virtual stores. The initial success of Amazon, perhaps the longest-enduring dot-com company, was based on selling items that were easy to ship.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-volume websites, such as Yahoo!, Amazon.com and eBay, offer hosting services for online stores to small retailers. These stores are presented within an integrated navigation framework. Collections of online stores are sometimes known as virtual shopping malls or online marketplaces.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers find a product of interest by using a search engine, visiting the Website of the retailer directly, or doing a search across many different vendors using a shopping search engine that offers price and quality comparisons.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most online retailers use shopping cart software that allows the customer to select multiple items to add to an order and adjust quantities. Once the order is complete, the customer moves through a "checkout" process during which payment and delivery information is collected. Some stores allow consumers to sign up for an online account that keeps payment information and shipping addresses on permanent record so that the checkout process can be automated. The consumer typically sees a confirmation page and is sent an e-mail confirmation once the transaction is complete. Additional emails notify the customer when the order has been shipped and may provide tracking information for the shipment.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less sophisticated stores may simply display a catalog on their Web site and rely on consumers to order by telephone or email.</p>
