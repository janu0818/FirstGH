        <p class="info">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;India will have about 500 million Internet users by June 2017, studies by Internet and Mobile Association of India and Indian Market Research Bureau indicate. Urban India with an estimated population of 444 million already has 269 million (60 percent) using the Internet.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rural India, with an estimated population of 906 million (2011 census), has only 163 million (17 percent) Internet users. Thus, there are potential approximately 750 million users still in rural India who are yet to become Internet users, if they are connected, the report adds.
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 100 million Indians will have made at least one online purchase by end-2017 as compared with 69 million in 2016, a joint report by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India and Resurgent India states.

		   <li> <h3 class="heading">Amazon India:<h3>
			    A large number of people from India swear by the services of amazon. Amazon and flipkart are always at war with each other and are always at close heels. Amazon has an equally large number of products as flipkart. In fact, Amazon apparently sells more than flipkart. Since amazon is an American company, it lacks the desi taste that would be preferred by an Indian. It would be wise to indianise its Indian domain. It would then be an instant hit amongst the masses.
                <br>

			<li>    <h3 class="heading"> Flipkart: </h3>
            	  This one has to come first hands down. The entire country is completely dependent on Flipkart for nearly all their shopping needs. Flipkart sells everything from gift vouchers to electronics to home appliances. In fact, statistics claim that there are more items on flipkart than in a mall. Hence, Indians are heavily reliant on flipkart for all their shopping needs.
